**Problem:
**Planning a trip manually is time-consuming and requires searching multiple websites.

Solution:
I built a Smart Travel Planner AI Agent that uses LLM-powered agents + Google tools to automatically generate travel itineraries, attractions, hotel suggestions, and budgets.

Key Features Used:

Multi-Agent System (planner agent + search agent + summarizer agent)

Google Search Tool (via MCP / Gemini tools)

Context engineering (structured itinerary generation)

4.SSession state + memory

Logging & evaluation

Optional loop agent for refining results

Impact:
This agent reduces 2–3 hours of manual travel planning into under 10 seconds.
